He feels pity for her and leaves her alive in a forest, where she lives happily with seven dwarfs (= very small people). The stepmother discovers that Snow White is alive, and gives her an apple full of poison. Snow White falls asleep after eating it and does not wake up until a prince kisses her, and all ends happily. The story was made into a successful Walt Disney film in 1937, and is a popular subject for pantomimes in Britain. In the film the seven dwarfs are called Dopey, Doc, Sneezy, Bashful, Sleepy, Grumpy and Happy."
