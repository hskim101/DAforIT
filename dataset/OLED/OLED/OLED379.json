He helped to make African American music popular with young white people and was an influence on many popular singers, including the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. He was also known as 'Elvis the Pelvis' because of the way he moved his lower body when he sang. His songs included Hound Dog (1956), All Shook Up (1957), It's Now or Never (1960) and Good Luck Charm (1962). He appeared in several films, including Jailhouse Rock (1957), Girls! Girls! Girls!(1962) and Viva Las Vegas (1964). Presley died at his home, Graceland, after accidentally taking too many drugs, though many people claim or pretend that he is still alive. In 1998 he was chosen for the Country Music Hall of Fame."
